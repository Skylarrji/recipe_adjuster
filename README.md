# Purpose 📝
As someone who loves to bake in my free time, I realized that all of the recipes that I would find from a quick Google search would serve more or fewer people than I intended to. For example, if I wanted to make cupcakes, the only cupcake recipes that are available would make enough batter to serve 12, even if I only wanted to make enough for my family of four. 
 
In addition, I realized that I usually need to scramble to find the appropriate measuring tools to measure out each ingredient, as they wouldn’t be in sorted order on the recipe.
 
As a result, I decided to create a recipe adjuster project using Processing, a low-level animation and GUI (Graphical User Interface) library built on the Java programming language. 


# Features 🖋️
### Recipe Selector
Choose from one of the following:
- Vanilla cupcakes (default)
- Chocolate chip cookies
- Fudgy brownies

### Serving Slider
Use the slider to determine your desired serving size (1-100 servings). 12 servings is the default and the recipe adjuster adjusts the recipe in real time as you move the slider.

### Sorting
Use the dropdown menu to sort the ingredients in ascending (default) or descending order!
